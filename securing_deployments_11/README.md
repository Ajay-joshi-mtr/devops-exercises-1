# Outcome 11 - Securing Deployments

An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Setting up hooks to scan for secure credentials/token before code is checked in to a repo
  - Ensuring credentials for production systems are stored in a secure vault and restricting access to it
  - Isolating security credentials/tokens for all different environments
  - Putting together tools to monitor and analyze system logs for suspicious activities
  - Running processes with the least required set of permissions to prevent privilege escalation
  - Setting up and configuring ssh daemon for private key authentication
  - Applying OS security patches to a system
  - Defining firewall rules to control access to the machine
  - Logging all connections to deployed machines
  - Securing data transfer using SSL
